# ProPresenterMiddleMan-Flutter

This is a simple Flutter Desktop application to replace the functionality of the
old ProPresenter Master/Slave module.

Download the version that works for your computer, run it on any computer on the same network
as the two ProPresenter instances you want to control, enter the networking details, and click
the arrow to connect.

Currently, the app will take slide trigger commands from the master and forward them to the slave.
